This last example reads a text file and prints out its content on the screen. 
We have created a while loop that reads the file line by line, using getline. 
The value returned by getline is a reference to the stream object itself, 
which when evaluated as a boolean expression (as in this while-loop) is true 
if the stream is ready for more operations, 
and false if either the end of the file has been reached or if some other error occurred.#
